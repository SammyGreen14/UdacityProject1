# UdacityProject1
Written by Sammy Green


## Motivation
This project answers business questions related to the predictability of diabetes based on common lifestyle factors. 
The code in this repository is used to fill in the blog post on medium which can be found at medium.com/@samantha.green/a70b75f458aa
### Questions Asked
Can diabetes be predicted if we know a person’s age, weight, income, education, race, mental health, gender, and state of residence?

Is diabetes an old person’s problem?

Does lack of education doom you to a life with diabetes?

Do women get diagnosed at a higher rate?

## Data
CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey from 2015. Phone survey asking participants lifestyle and health questions

## Installation 
Packages used include numby, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, seaborn

## Aditional Notes
Rather than impute values to fix missing data I chose to remove the effected columns or rows based on the large data set that remained even after all the needed deletions. In a future itteration, I could add the imputed values.

## Resolution
While older and less educated populations see higher incidence of diabetes, predicting your chances of getting diabetes involves more factors than a person’s age, weight, income, education, race, mental health, gender, and state of residence.
